#lang racket/base

;; Benchmark driver
;;
;; Usage:
;;   run.rkt BENCHMARK
;; This will:
;; - Create directories `BENCHMARK/benchmark` and `BENCHMARK/benchmark/base`
;; - Spawn jobs for each of the 2**n configurations
;;   Each job will create a new directory & save results to a file
;; - Aggregate the results from all sub-jobs

(provide
  run-benchmark
  ;; Same as calling from the command line, just pass argv vector
)
