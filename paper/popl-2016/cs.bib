    "The analogy between types and contracts raises the question of how
    many features of static type systems can be expressed as dynamic
    contracts.  An important feature missing in prior work on
    contracts is parametricity, as represented by the polymorphic
    types in languages like Standard ML.

    We present a contract counterpart to parametricity.  We explore
    multiple designs for such a system and present one that is simple
    and incurs minimal execution overhead.  We show how to extend the
    notion of contract blame to our definition.  We present a form of
    inference that can often save programmers from having to
    explicitly instantiate many parametric contracts.  Finally, we
    present several examples that illustrate how this system mimics
    the feel and properties of parametric polymorphism in typed
    languages."}

    "Programmers constantly design, implement, and program in little
    languages. Two different approaches to the implementation of
    little languages have evolved. One emphasizes the design of little
    languages from scratch, using conventional technology to implement
    interpreters and compilers. The other advances the idea of
    extending a general-purpose host language; that is, the little
    language shares the host language'ss features (variables, data,
    loops, functions) where possible; its interpreters and compilers;
    and even its type soundness theorem. The second approach is often
    called a language \emph{embedding}.

    This paper directs the attention of little language designers to a
    badly neglected area: the programming environments of little
    languages. We argue that an embedded little language should
    inherit not only the host language's syntactic and semantic
    structure, but also its programming environment.

    We illustrate the idea with our DrScheme programming environment
    and S-XML, a little transformation language for XML
    trees. DrScheme provides a host of tools for Scheme: a syntax
    analysis tool, a static debugger, an algebraic stepper, a portable
    plugin system, and an interactive evaluator. S-XML supports the
    definition of XML languages using a simple form of schemas, the
    convenient creation of XML data, and the definition of XML
    transformations.

    The S-XML embedding consists of two parts: a library of functions
    and a set of syntactic extensions. The elaboration of a syntactic
    extension into core Scheme preserves the information necessary to
    report the results of an analysis or of a program evaluation at
    the source level. As a result, all of DrScheme's tools are
    naturally extended to the embedded language. The process of
    embedding the S-XML language into Scheme directly creates a
    full-fledged S-XML environment. 

    We believe that this method of language implementation may be
    generalized to other languages and other environments, and
    represents a substantial improvement upon current practice."}

    "
    DrScheme provides a graphical user interface for editing and
    interactively evaluating Scheme programs on all major graphical
    platforms (Windows 95/nt, MacOs, Unix/X). The environment is
    especially well­suited to beginning programmers because it
    supports a tower of Scheme subsets. Each level corresponds to a
    particular stage in a typical introductory Scheme course and
    implements a stringent set of syntactic checks. The environment
    also pinpoints run­time exceptions in a graphical manner and
    implements a mostly functional read­eval­print loop.

    DrScheme's most advanced component is a powerful static
    debugger. It permits programmers to inspect programs for potential
    safety violations before running them. If the debugger discovers a
    potential problem, it explains the problem by drawing a value­flow
    graph over the program text. The value­flow graphs shows how an
    inappropriate value may reach a program operation and trigger a
    run­time check.
    
    The development of DrScheme in Scheme validated the strengths of
    Scheme, but also revealed several weaknesses. To overcome the
    latter, the underlying Scheme implementation was extended with a
    class­based object system, a language of program units, and a
    sophisticated GUI engine. All of these extensions are available to
    the programmer, who can thus interactively create fully portable,
    graphical applications."}

    "DrScheme is a programming environment for Scheme. It fully
    integrates a graphics-enriched editor, a parser for multiple
    variants of Scheme, a functional read-eval-print loop, and an
    algebraic printer. The environment is especially useful for
    students, because it has a tower of syntactically restricted
    variants of Scheme that are designed to catch typical student
    mistakes and explain them in terms the students understand. The
    environment is also useful for professional programmers, due to
    its sophisticated programming tools, such as the static debugger,
    and its advanced language features, such as units and mixins.
    
    Beyond the ordinary programming environment tools, DrScheme
    provides an algebraic stepper, a context-sensitive syntax checker,
    and a static debugger. The stepper reduces Scheme programs to
    values, according to the reduction semantics of Scheme. It is
    useful for explaining the semantics of linguistic facilities and
    for studying the behavior of small programs. The syntax checker
    annotates programs with font and color changes based on the
    syntactic structure of the program. On demand, it draws arrows
    that point from bound to binding occurrences of identifiers. It
    also supports alpha-renaming. Finally, the static debugger
    provides a type inference system that explains specific inferences
    in terms of a value-flow graph, selectively overlaid on the

    "While class-based object-oriented programming languages provide a
    flexible mechanism for re-using and managing related pieces of
    code, they typically lack linguistic facilities for specifying a
    uniform extension of many classes with one set of fields and
    methods.  As a result, programmers are unable to express certain
    abstractions over classes.

    In this paper we develop a model of class-to-class functions that
    we refer to as \emph{mixins}.  A mixin function maps a class to an
    extended class by adding or overriding fields and methods.
    Programming with mixins is similar to programming with single
    inheritance classes, but mixins more directly encourage
    programming to interfaces.

    The paper develops these ideas within the context of Java.  The
    results are
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item an intuitive model of an essential Java subset;
    \item an extension that explains and models mixins; and
    \item type soundness theorems for these languages.

    "Many modern programs provide operating system-style services to

    provide these services.  As a result, the solutions are
    inefficient, and impose a serious overhead on the programmer of
    dynamic extensions.
    
    In this paper, we show that a Web server implemented in a suitably
    extended high-level programming language overcomes all these
    problems.  First, building a server in such a language is
    straightforward. Second, the server delivers static content at
    performance levels comparable to a conventional server. Third, the
    Web server delivers dynamic content at a much higher rate than a
    conventional server, which is important because a significant

  abstract =     "Verification and Validation (V\&V) is currently
                 performed during application development for many
                 systems, especially safety-critical and
                 mission-critical systems. The V\&V process is intended
                 to discover errors, especially errors related to
                 critical processing, as early as possible during the
                 development process. The system application provides
                 the context under which the software artifacts are
                 validated. This paper describes a framework that
                 extends V\&V from an individual application system to a
                 product line of systems that are developed within an
                 architecture-based software engineering environment.
                 This framework includes the activities of traditional
                 application-level V\&V, and extends these activities
                 into domain engineering and into the transition between
                 domain engineering and application engineering. The
                 framework includes descriptions of the types of
                 activities to be performed during each of the
                 life-cycle phases, and provides motivation for the
                 activities.",

  abstract =     "Software reuse is being pursued in an attempt to
		  improve programmer productivity. The concept of reuse
		  is to permit various work products of software
		  development to be used on more than one project in
		  order to amortize their development costs. Productivity
		  is not the only advantage of reuse although it is the
		  most widely publicized. By incorporating reusable
		  components into a new product, the components bring
		  with them whatever qualities they possess, and these
		  can contribute to the quality of the new product. This
		  suggests that reuse might be exploited for achieving
		  quality as an entirely separate goal from improving
		  productivity. If useful properties pertaining to
		  quality could be shown to be present in products as a
		  direct result of software development based on reuse,
		  this might be a cost-effective way of achieving those
		  qualities irrespective of the productivity advantages.
		  The adjective certified is sometimes used to describe
		  components that have been tested in some way prior to
		  entry into a library but the term certified is not
		  formally defined in the reuse literature. In this
		  paper, we address the issue of certifying reusable
		  components. We advocate the development of software by
		  reuse with the specific intent of establishing as many
		  of the required properties in the final product as
		  possible by depending upon properties present in the
		  reusable components. For this goal to succeed, a
		  precise definition of certification of reusable
		  components is required and such a definition is
		  presented. The benefits of the definition and the way
		  in which it supports the goal are explored.",

                      use of type information handled through mechanical typechecking

                      of the language it is embedded in; it adapts equally well to 
                      functional, imperative, object-oriented, and algebraic programming, 
                      and it is not incompatible with relational and concurrent programming. 
                      The main purpose of this paper is to show how typeful programming is 
                      best supported by sophisticated type systems, and how these systems 
                      can help in clarifying programming issues and in adding power and 
                      regularity to languages.},
